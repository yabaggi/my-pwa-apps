├── games/    ← Extract ZIP contents here
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifest.json
│   ├── sw.js
│   ├── icons/
│   └── ...
├── app2/                         ← Another PWA

```

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Extract Files
```bash
cd /path/to/pwaApps
unzip games-pwa.zip -d games
```

#### 2. Verify Structure
```bash
ls -R games/
# Should show: index.html, manifest.json, sw.js, icons/, etc.
```

#### 3. Start Python Server (from parent directory)
```bash
cd /path/to/pwaApps
python -m http.server 8000
```

#### 4. Access Your PWA

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### In Browser Console (F12)
You should see:
```
✓ Service Worker registered: http://localhost:8000/games/
✓ Service Worker URL: http://localhost:8000/games/sw.js

⚙️ PWA Configuration:
  - App Name: GameHub - Discover Free Games
  - App ID: gamehub-id
  - Start URL: /games/
  - Scope: /games/
  - Folder: games
```

### In Chrome DevTools → Application Tab
- **Service Worker:** Status should be "activated and running"
- **Manifest:** Should load without errors

### Server Logs (Success)
```
GET /games/ HTTP/1.1" 200 -
GET /games/manifest.json HTTP/1.1" 200 -
GET /games/sw.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
GET /games/icons/icon-192x192.png HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
**All 200 OK - No 404 errors!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Error for sw.js

**Problem:**
```
GET /games/sw.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

**Solution:**
- Make sure you started the server from the **parent directory** (pwaApps), not from inside games
- Access the app at: `http://localhost:8000/games/` (with trailing slash)

### Issue: Service Worker Not Registering

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Are you accessing via localhost? (HTTPS exception)
2. ✅ Did you start server from parent directory?
3. ✅ Is the URL correct with trailing slash?
4. ✅ Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Install Button Not Appearing

**Solutions:**
- Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
- Ensure all PWA requirements are met
- Check that manifest.json is loading
- Verify service worker is active

## 📱 For Termux Users (Android)

### Perfect Setup for Multiple PWAs

```bash
# 1. Create structure
cd ~
mkdir pwaApps
cd pwaApps

# 2. Extract your PWA
unzip ~/Downloads/games-pwa.zip -d games

# 3. Start server from pwaApps
cd ~/pwaApps
python -m http.server 8000

# 4. Access in Chrome
# http://localhost:8000/games/
```

### Add More Apps

```bash
# Generate another PWA, then:
cd ~/pwaApps
unzip ~/Downloads/anotherapp-pwa.zip -d anotherapp

# Server still running, access:
# http://localhost:8000/anotherapp/
```

Your structure:
```
pwaApps/
├── games/  ← This app
├── anotherapp/                 ← Another app
└── games/                      ← Yet another app
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy Each App Separately
Upload the folder to:
- Netlify: https://www.netlify.com/drop
- Vercel: https://vercel.com
- GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com

### Option 2: Deploy All Apps Together
Keep the multi-app structure on your hosting:
```
yourdomain.com/games/
yourdomain.com/app2/
yourdomain.com/app3/
```

**Important:** All hosting must use HTTPS (localhost is exception)
