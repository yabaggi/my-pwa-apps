The bigger the organization, the more unavoidable is its immorality and blind stupidity.\" Each of these systems promotes itself by pointing out the moral failings of the other, but these moral failings are actually failings brought about by people acting within the context of large organizations. What is truly needed is to learn a structure of organization of human beings that provides for the organized group the same capacity and propensity for moral behavior that is possessed by individuals.",

You must feel every possible emotion to realize you\u2019re really alive, you\u2019re really living. If you build walls and you hide behind them in fear, you\u2019re not embracing moments, you\u2019re not actually living. And if you\u2019re not living, then you\u2019re dead. Maybe not physically, but mentally and emotionally, you are non-existent. Why would you want to waste such precious time, non-existing, especially behind a crumby wall? Fear? Fear of what? Fear of something great? Fear of something amazing? Hurt? Fear of pain? Isn\u2019t pain what makes us appreciate feelings of absolute happiness and love? Who doesn\u2019t want happiness? Let me be the one to tell you that this life is short, it\u2019s damn short. So, let go of your grudges, your past, your stupid walls and feel reality. Avoidance is not life. Pain is life, happiness is life, emotion is life. Live your damn life. Stop being dead. Embrace every good feeling in your heart and soul and act on it without the fear of hurt, because undoubtedly hurt will happen, but hurt will also disappear and lead to the most valuable feelings in this world. Regret is not something you want to live with in this short, short life. So follow that tiny fist sized drum in your chest because it is honest and it is true. Take those fucking chances, take them knowing this world is full of opportunity, opportunity for great things, absolutely amazing fucking things. Take chance because that is living and no one wants to be dead. No one really wants to hide behind these crumby walls. Walls are built for protection, but guess what? You\u2019re not protecting yourself, you are limiting yourself. You\u2019re limiting your existence. You are the source of your suffering. You\u2019re missing out on the best opportunities by hiding behind these shit walls. So you8 want to play it safe? Why? Life is for taking the risks, for closing your eyes and taking that damn leap of faith. This, this is living; this is your one shot. So take the risk, find opportunity, break down walls, fell the hurt, feel the happiness, live in the now, embrace what your heart is telling you and love EVERY damn moment of your existence. And please keep living, really, whole-heartedly keep living.",

A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. \u201cWe will come up and rescue you!\u201d they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, \u201cUse your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!\u201dThe flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, \"Grab my hand and I will pull you up!\" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. \u201cNo thank you! God will save me!\u201dShortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.When in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, \u201cI put all of my faith in You. Why didn\u2019t You come and save me?\u201dAnd God said, \u201cSon, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter.
