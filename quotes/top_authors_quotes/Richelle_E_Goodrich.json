My eyelids fluttered, blinking at a stunning reflection of daylight off the glass. The blue beyond gave an exquisite glow to my room. All of it was an invitation to bask in a new day\u2014an invitation I declined because none of that mattered to me. The world might as well come to a dark and ugly end.
