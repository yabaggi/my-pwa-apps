They embrace simplicity and create beauty based on requirements other than their own.

People aren\u2019t disk drives. Public schools, colleges and universities, churches, museums, and many hospitals, all of which have been subjected to disruptive innovation, have revenues and expenses and infrastructures, but they aren\u2019t industries in the same way that manufacturers of hard-disk drives or truck engines or drygoods are industries. Journalism isn\u2019t an industry in that sense, either.Doctors have obligations to their patients, teachers to their students, pastors to their congregations, curators to the public, and journalists to their readers--obligations that lie outside the realm of earnings, and are fundamentally different from the obligations that a business executive has to employees, partners, and investors. Historically, institutions like museums, hospitals, schools, and universities have been supported by patronage, donations made by individuals or funding from church or state. The press has generally supported itself by charging subscribers and selling advertising. (Underwriting by corporations and foundations is a funding source of more recent vintage.) Charging for admission, membership, subscriptions and, for some, earning profits are similarities these institutions have with businesses. Still, that doesn\u2019t make them industries, which turn things into commodities and sell them for gain.",

Twenty years ago we had the ideal of the lawyer, of the doctor, of the statesman, of the gentleman, of the man of letters, of the soldier. Now the lawyer is simply a supernumerary enlisting under any banner for pay; the doctor is overshadowed by the specialist with his business development of the possibilities of the rich; we have politicians, and politics are deemed impossible for a gentleman; the gentleman cultured, simple, hospitable, and kind, is of the dying generation; the soldier is simply on parade.\"\"Wow!\" said Ricketts, jingling his chips. \"They're off.\"\"Everything has conformed to business, everything has been made to pay.

If dishonesty can live in a gorgeous palace with pictures on all its walls, and gems in all its cupboards, with marble and ivory in all its corners, and can give Apician dinners, and get into Parliament, and deal in millions, then dishonesty is not disgraceful, and the man dishonest after such a fashion is not a low scoundrel. Instigated, I say, by some such reflections as these, I sat down in my new house to write The Way We Live Now. And as I had ventured to take the whip of the satirist into my hand, I went beyond the iniquities of the great speculator who robs everybody, and made an onslaught also on other vices;--on the intrigues of girls who want to get married, on the luxury of young men who prefer to remain single, and on the puffing propensities of authors who desire to cheat the public into buying their volumes.",

In England, even as late as 1740, a child could be hanged for stealing a rag of cotton. But in the Congo, communal life persisted. The idea of private property was a strange one, and thefts were punished with fines or various degrees of servitude. A Congolese leader told of the Portuguese legal codes asked a Portuguese once, teasingly, 'What is the penalty in Portugal for anyone who puts his feet on the ground?",

It is greed that compels dairymen to skim every bit of goodness from milk to make other products and then to fill the swill left with chalk and sell it at profit. Greed tempts butchers to grind up the meat of sick cows with well ones and mix it into sausage along with offal and dung to extend the amount of 'meat' that they can sell. Greed motivates bakers to use flour devoid of the wheat germ and the nutritious outer husk and to add alum and chlorine to make bread look whiter and to cook faster. Americans are being poisoned, all in the name of profit, producing a weak-minded race of people who are given to lust and desire.",

They had not tried to find the answer and they had gone on living as if no answer was necessary. But each had known a moment when, in lonely, naked honesty, he had felt the need of an answer.",

    "quote": "Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, born on January 28, 1853, is known as the George Washington of Cuba, or is perhaps better identified with Simon Bolivar, the liberator of South America. Although he admired and visited the United States, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed realized that not only would he have to free his country from Spain, he would also have to prevent the United States from interfering in Cuba\u2019s internal affairs. By his admirers, he was considered a great Latin American intellectual, and his newspaper Patria became the voice of \u201cCuban Independence.\u201d After years of suppression, the Cuban struggle for independence began in 1868. At the age of 17, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed was jailed in Cuba and then exiled to Spain because of his revolutionary activities. It was during this time in his life that he published a pamphlet describing the atrocities he had experienced while being imprisoned in Cuba. He strongly believed in racial equality and denounced the horrors of people having to live under a dictatorship.In 1878, Mart\u00ed was allowed to return to Cuba under a general amnesty, but was once again banished from Cuba after being accused of conspiracy against the Spanish authorities. From 1881 to 1895, he lived and worked in New York City. Moving to Florida, he organized forces for a three-pronged attack supporting the smoldering Cuban War of Independence. It was during one of the first battles that he was killed at the Battle of Dos R\u00edos in Cuba, and thus became a national hero and martyr when he was only 42 years old.",

It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It's your mission on earth.",

    "quote": "Weeping WillowWeeping willow, how your elongated leaves dangle in the mist of the air, you bring such true comfort into the needful eye.How your leaves sway from left to right, providing your own intricate dance so divine.Weeping willow, you provide the most comforting shade upon your layer of leaves making me feel encircled with love and safety.Weeping willow, as I lay under your silvery leaves, I look up for a helping hand, I see strength within your structure, can you help me?Weeping willow, as I climb upon you will you make sure I won't fall, will you catch me if I do?Weeping willow, as I sit upon you looking to the sky through your rustling leaves, will you hear my pain? Can I overcome such things? The weeping willows long leafed branches sway back and forth providing the gentlest of winds across one's face. The eyes close so slowly, a sigh escapes one's mouth.As one sits on the branch they feel if there is someone watching over them, comfort arises as the branches nestle one's sorrows. A tear slowly slides down their cheek as if all emotion was escaping them. The wind starts to slowly blow, once again the elongated leaved branches sway back and forth against the song of the wind, creating one's smile to appear slowly but surely. The long silvery leaves brush against ones cheek, as if it was the hand of comfort, wiping the sadness away. Weeping willow, I will climb down now, I have heard what you have had to say... The one steps down and walks around to the back of the willow tree as it faces such gleaming waters. They look at the carving at the back of the tree, something that has been carved there for years upon the dark bark. Their body slumps to the ground as their back presses against the bark, fingers reaching up to trace the well known loved one. The carved initials of a beloved memory. The one whispers, \"Thank you for hearing me, Dad.",

    "quote": "Encouragement, Love, HopeThere was a man that struggled with every step and walked each step with fear. As we all know when you walk and pave a path of fear, the steps slow down and the true light of faith dims. His family did, however, stand behind him. Though his steps were slow and not going far, his family followed covering each of those steps with encouragement and hope. As he kept walking and turned his head, the people who cared most weren't clear. His fear had taken over and there was uncertainty that slowed him down even further. The family that stands behind you is the one who gives you the push you need to keep going.The man was saddened with fear and started to sob. Mystery of the unknown was the overwhelming door he wasn't ready to open. His family followed right behind him, saying, \"We are there for you, you are strong; you can make it through the toughest path with the strongest light of hope.\"It seemed he couldn't hear all that was said. It was as if he wasn't truly listening to the strongest words, but to the heavy negativity that kept drowning him in his fear. His steps slowed down even further. He cried some more and was shaken even more by the unknown that was ahead. It was that he didn't want to take a chance of what could come ahead, what could be the most enlightening and most life changing steps he could take to better himself in the future.His family still stood behind him with every step he took. Every time he looked back it was getting dimmer and dimmer, but they were still there. They spoke softly to him, \"Everybody has risks in their lives, even obstacles they must over come. It will only make you stronger in the end, without risks in life, there is no chance.\"He didn't hear them speak; he heard it as if it was another language, something so far from understanding.The man found a bench and sat down. He was tired and didn't want to walk any further. His eyes filled with tears that streamed down his cheeks. His hands starting to cover his face, drowning in the fear that was overwhelming him. Again his loving family was there, but he couldn't see. They were around him with heart-filling encouragement and love, and best of all, that blessedness of hopeThe man lay down on the bench; his tears had soaked his cheeks and palms of his hands and fell asleep. When he awoke, his eyes slowly opened, trying to look around, finding that he was in an unfamiliar place. His vision was a bit fuzzy. He looked down and started to realize he wasn't on the bench anymore.He saw his legs and started to look up further; he was in a hospital gown. The man's eyes grew even more confused. He stood there in silence as his head slowly tilted up. He didn't understand why here was there.His eyes turn and he looks, as he notices numerous cords",

    "quote": "Respected Teacher,My son will have to learn that all men are not just, all men are not true. But teach him also that for ever scoundrel there is a hero; that for every selfish politician, there is a dedicated leader. Teach him that for every enemy there is a friend.It will take time, I know; but teach him, if you can, that a dollar earned is far more valuable than five found.Teach him to learn to lose and also to enjoy winning.Steer him away from envy, if you can.Teach him the secret of quite laughter. Let him learn early that the bullies are the easiest to tick.Teach him, if you can, the wonder of books... but also give him quiet time to ponder over the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on a green hill.In school teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat.Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if every one tells him they are wrong.Teach him to be gentle with gentle people and tough with the tough.Try to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd when every one is getting on the bandwagon.Teach him to listen to all men but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth and take only the good that comes through.Teach him, if you can, how to laugh when he is sad. Teach him there is no shame in tears. Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness.Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders; but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul.Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob\u2026 and to stand and fight if he thinks he\u2019s right.Treat him gently; but do not cuddle him because only the test of fire makes fine steel.Let him have the courage to be impatient, let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself because then he will always have sublime faith in mankind.This is a big order; but see what you can do. He is such a fine little fellow, my son.(Abraham Lincoln\u2019s letter to his son\u2019s Head Master)",

Disease and war and famine and a million other things prevent them from wielding the pen. But for those of us who can, should it not be our great privilege to live the lives we've imagined?

Always move to find comfort in brighter places, andAlways deem yourself to be courageous when others call upon you.......",

A good investment.\u201d And I know for sure that the people who have shown me any amount of true kindness, can say for certain, that it's one of the best things they\u2019ve done in life, because I make sure that they can say that about me. Ask anyone who\u2019s been kind to me, and they will tell you. Because this is my creed in life. There is no greater evil, in my opinion, than the evil that infests a person who takes for granted any amount of true kindness given to her/him.

The Trinity must be tainted by it; there must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon Himself? Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful, spoil what is perfect? Love. That was Father Martin's answer.",

I swim in a single drop in this basin of eternal waters, and after that drop evaporates, it's gone! But then you could argue that if life is just a drop, then why even bother? Well, yes it is a drop, but it's a meaningful drop, an unforgettable drop, and a beautiful one! It's so unforgettable, that when you come back again, if you choose to, you will remember it in your dreams at night!

Nothing follows the laws of common nature and we live in a wild, wild awakening and the only map we have is the map of the stars! We're called to see the lighting tear at the horizon, we're chosen to roar with the tempests, but we're also the first ones to see the suns rise, the first ones to watch the moons form anew!

However, I have come to learn at this time in my life, that such an attitude is all good for a while, but then there does come a point where you must see and identify yourself; also see and identify others! You have to be able to identify yourself as someone who is made happy by this and as someone who doesn't like that; then when you meet people, discern if those same things are the things that make them happy and if those same things are the things that they don't like, because at a point in time it becomes beneficial to you, to not waste time on blending in behalf of virtue but rather it becomes beneficial to you, to see yourself and go into the direction that makes you happy, taking people with you that are already going in that same direction and who also do not like the things that you do not like. At the end of the day, there are those paths in life, and you have to take one of them, you can't walk down all of them.",

My heart fought and pleaded, saying it wasn't true, that I was German, and only in Germany would I be content. In one of the few times in my life, intellect overruled emotion. Germany wasn't the key to my happiness. I couldn't deny what I had experienced, and my last hope for a key to the castle door died. International adoption destroyed the connection to my heritage. It is only conjuncture to guess how my life might have turned out under different circumstances, but there is one certainty: If I had remained in the orphanage or had been adopted by German parents, I never would have suffered the loss of my national identity.

He gazed at the air as he spoke, as if lecturing an invisible audience - as perhaps he was. \"It certainly is not a passive recording mechanism, like a digital disc or a tape. It is more like a story-telling machine. Sensory information is broken down into shards of perception, which are broken down again to be stored as memory fragments. And at night, as the body rests, these fragments are brought out from storage, reassembled and replayed. Each run-through etches them deeper into the brain's neural structure. And each time a memory is rehearsed or recalled it is elaborated. We may add a little, lose a little, tinker with the logic, fill in sections that have faded, perhaps even conflate disparate events. \"In extreme cases, we refer to this as confabulation. The brain creates and recreates the past, producing, in the end, a version of events that may bear little resemblance to what actually occurred. To first order, I believe it's true to say that everything I remember is false.",

But waking up was useless\u2014I was suffocated by the countless sand. Someone said to me:You have wakened not out of sleep, but into a prior dream, and that dream lies within another, and so on, to infinity, which is the number of the grains of sand. The path that you are to take is endless, and you will die before you have truly awakened.I felt lost.

The blood came through the keyhole of a locked door which communicated with the next room. I suppose the two rooms had originally been designed en suite. It ran down the door panel with a viscous ripple, like the artificial one created in the conduit of Trumpingdon Street. But it was heavy, and smelled.

You\u2019re making all the decisions about who I can be and what I can do, but I can\u2019t make any decisions about who you are.\u201d \u201cWell, for one thing, I\u2019m not eighteen. For another, you have control over how I feel and that\u2019s still power. Finally, maybe you grew up with a boot on the back of your neck so you need all of this independence to feel like you\u2019ve accomplished shit, but you need to get over that. I take care of the people I love. My money can make your life easier and that makes my life easier. I\u2019m not molding you and I don\u2019t think you need molding anyway. The only difference between us is that I know I\u2019m a finished product and you think you still need to change.

Whether or not you were aware that there was something missing in your life, you will be when you meet the person you want.

You recognize them with such certainty because you already, in a certain sense, know them; and because you have quite literally been expecting them, you feel as though you have known them for ever, and yet, at the same time, they are quite foreign to you.

Not only of the small or fast, but of visibility as such. The visuality of the visible and the invisible is found in the mixture of the body and its world, of your body and your world, all your worlds, all your bodies in this world and all those others. Painting is the process by which the visuality of the visible and invisible is made manifest: \"Painting mixes up all our categories in laying out its oneiric universe of carnal essences, of effective likenesses, of mute meanings.\" Each painting is a universal archive, a picture of the universe, a universal image\u2014and like a dream.",

That\u2019s a metaphor, right? And you use it so that you can be understood. Now let\u2019s say you want to take those same imagistic principles but apply them to a much more complex idea than having a headache, like, for instance, the yearning that one feels for one\u2019s dreams. And you can see the dream but you can\u2019t cross the bay to get to the green light that embodies your dream. And you want to talk about how socio-economic class in America is a barrier \u2013 a bay-like barrier, some would say \u2013 that stands between you and the green light and makes that gap unbridgeable.

    "quote": "March 1898What a strange dream I had last night! I wandered in the warm streets of a port, in the low quarter of some Barcelona or Marseille. The streets were noisome, with their freshly-heaped piles of ordure outside the doors, in the blue shadows of their high roofs. They all led down towards the sea. The gold-spangled sea, seeming as if it had been polished by the sun, could be seen at the end of each thoroughfare, bristling with yard-arms and luminous masts. The implacable blue of the sky shone brilliantly overhead as I wandered through the long, cool and sombre corridors in the emptiness of a deserted district: a quarter which might almost have been dead, abruptly abandoned by seamen and foreigners. I was alone, subjected to the stares of prostitutes seated at their windows or in the doorways, whose eyes seemed to ransack my very soul.They did not speak to me. Leaning on the sides of tall bay-windows or huddled in doorways, they were silent. Their breasts and arms were bare, bizarrely made up in pink, their eyebrows were darkened, they wore their hair in corkscrew-curls, decorated with paper flowers and metal birds. And they were all exactly alike!They might have been huge marionettes, or tall mannequin dolls left behind in panic - for I divined that some plague, some frightful epidemic brought from the Orient by sailors, had swept through the town and emptied it of its inhabitants. I was alone with these simulacra of love, abandoned by the men on the doorsteps of the brothels.I had already been wandering for hours without being able to find a way out of that miserable quarter, obsessed by the fixed and varnished eyes of all those automata, when I was seized by the sudden thought that all these girls were dead, plague-stricken and putrefied by cholera where they stood, in the solitude, beneath their carmine plaster masks... and my entrails were liquefied by cold. In spite of that harrowing chill, I was drawn closer to a motionless girl. I saw that she was indeed wearing a mask... and the girl in the next doorway was also masked... and all of them were horribly alike under their identical crude colouring...I was alone with the masks, with the masked corpses, worse than the masks... when, all of a sudden, I perceived that beneath the false faces of plaster and cardboard, the eyes of these dead women were alive.Their vitreous eyes were looking at me...I woke up with a cry, for in that moment I had recognised all the women. They all had the eyes of Kranile and Willie, of Willie the mime and Kranile the dancer. Every one of the dead women had Kranile's left eye and Willie's right eye... so that every one of them appeared to be squinting.Am I to be haunted by masks now?",

    "quote": "He hoped and feared,' continued Solon, in a low. mournful voice; 'but at times he was very miserable, because he did not think it possible that so much happiness was reserved for him as the love of this beautiful, innocent girl. At night, when he was in bed, and all the world was dreaming, he lay awake looking up at the old books against the walls, thinking how he could bring about the charming of her heart. One night, when he was thinking of this, he suddenly found himself in a beautiful country, where the light did not come from sun or moon or stars, but floated round and over and in everything like the atmosphere. On all sides he heard mysterious melodies sung by strangely musical voices. None of the features of the landscape was definite; yet when he looked on the vague harmonies of colour that melted one into another before his sight he was filled with a sense of inexplicable beauty. On every side of him fluttered radiant bodies, which darted to and fro through the illuminated space. They were not birds, yet they flew like birds; and as each one crossed the path of his vision he felt a strange delight flash through his brain, and straightaway an interior voice seemed to sing beneath the vaulted dome of his temples a verse containing some beautiful thought. Little fairies were all this time dancing and fluttering around him, perching on his head, on his shoulders, or balancing themselves on his fingertips. 'Where am I?' he asked. 'Ah, Solon?' he heard them whisper, in tones that sounded like the distant tinkling of silver bells, \"this land is nameless; but those who tread its soil, and breathe its air, and gaze on its floating sparks of light, are poets forevermore.' Having said this, they vanished, and with them the beautiful indefinite land, and the flashing lights, and the illumined air; and the hunchback found himself again in bed, with the moonlight quivering on the floor, and the dusty books on their shelves, grim and mouldy as ever.'(\"The Wondersmith\")",

In the dream, he sat in the kitchen of his mother's house at the table on his usual place. He could hear her handle pots and pans and sigh occasionally. Sitting there filled his heart with sadness and also with a long missed feeling of comfort until he realised that the chair and the table were much too small for him: it was a child's chair and he could barely fit his long legs under the table. He was worried that his mother might scold him for being so large and for not wearing pants. Gregory, in the dream, felt his manhood press against his belly while he was crouching uncomfortably, not daring to move.",

    "quote": "The finished clock is resplendent. At first glance it is simply a clock, a rather large black clock with a white face and a silver pendulum. Well crafted, obviously, with intricately carved woodwork edges and a perfectly painted face, but just a clock.But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else.The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side. Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully.All of this takes hours.The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played.At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dress in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern.After midnight, the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the cloud returns. The number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes.By noon it is a clock again, and no longer a dream.",

    "quote": "Candice had been writing for two days\u2019 straight, working on her publisher\u2019s book deadline, when she wrote the end, smiled, and set the book aside. She would start proofing it tomorrow after she\u2019d given her brain a break. Now she\u2019d do what she always did when she finished a book, or reached a good stopping point in one. Clean house. Check her backlog of emails. Pick up some more groceries. And take a run on the wolf side.She finished vacuuming and dusting, swearing every window must let all the outdoors in, and then started a batch of gingerbread cookie cutouts to celebrate finishing another book and the Christmas holiday season. While they were baking, she finally settled down to check her emails. Fan mail always came first, and one from her website got her attention right off. She opened it up and read: Hello, I\u2019m Owen Nottingham, private investigator for White River Investigations, White River Falls, Minnesota and my client, Strom Hart, hired me to locate you. Your parents, John and Cynthia Hart, left you an inheritance and you need to see the lawyer about it so that you can claim it. I need to verify that you are the right woman first. Is there any way that we can possibly meet and get this taken care of so you can collect your inheritance? Strom Hart will be the one to receive it by the end of the month otherwise. His assistant, Jim Winchester, said Mr. Hart is your uncle.\u201dShe reread the message again, not believing her eyes, tears filling them. She quickly looked at the date of the message. Two days ago! She knew she shouldn\u2019t have neglected her emails, but when she was into the story, she couldn\u2019t break away.She ground her teeth, raised her fingers to respond, and heard a knocking at her door. No one came here. Never. Ever. Not even salesmen.She glanced at her phases-of-the moon calendar. The waxing gibbous was just beginning. She should be fine. Just to be on the safe side, in case the person at the door was trouble, she pulled a can of mace from her desk drawer and headed for the door. She peered through the peephole. A handsome black-haired man waited at the door, with rugged features and intense blue eyes. He was dressed in a black suit, a red shirt, and a dark purple tie covered in red, purple, and gold Christmas balls. She raised her brows.\u201cI\u2019m Owen Nottingham,\u201d he said to the door, holding up his PI license and driver\u2019s license. He couldn\u2019t know that she was watching him, so he must have hoped she was there, observing him. \u201cI tried getting hold of you on your contact form on your website about your inheritance. Your contact form might not be working, so I had to locate you in person.\u201dSo this was the man who had sent the message. But was he for real? He had to be. He wouldn\u2019t have come all this way to see her if he wasn\u2019t. But how had he found her? She opened the door, the bells jingling on her Christmas wreath, and he glanced down at the can of mace in her hand. He smiled, his gaze holding hers with such intensity, it was as though he could see clear through to her soul. \u201cReally, just a PI doing my job.\u201dA chilly breeze carried his scent to her. Wolf scent. She felt so lightheaded all at once, she grabbed the door to keep herself upright, and dropped the can of mace on the tile floor. It clattered, but she couldn\u2019t reach for it if her life depended on it. Oh. My. God.This couldn\u2019t be real. He couldn\u2019t be real. No wonder he was talking to the door. He must have heard her footfalls as she\u2019d approached.He took a deep breath at the same time and his eyes widened in surprise when he smelled her scent. His hand shot out to grab her arm and steady her. For a minute, as she tried to control her breathing, her heart rate, neither of which she could steady. She felt like she was going to pass out.\u201cHell, you\u2019re the wolf I saw across the White River, aren\u2019t you?",

    "quote": "Owen couldn\u2019t believe his luck. Candice Mayfair was the beautiful white wolf he\u2019d seen that day so long ago. Not that she looked like a wolf right now. He only knew she was the wolf, unequivocally, because he recognized her scent. After the initial shock of seeing an unfamiliar and intriguing Arctic she-wolf, he\u2019d gone after her.The whole pack had gone on a run that night, but they knew to stay far away from any campsite. He and the other guys had swum across the river to explore a bit. Cameron and his mate had stayed on the other side with the kids. He\u2019d even swum back across the river to find her and discovered her scent had led right to one of the tents. Since she had moved into the tent, he knew she had to be one of their shifter kind. He\u2019d even hung around the next day, waiting to catch a glimpse of her, but there were several women, and he had no idea which one had been her. Two blonds, a couple of brunettes, and a red-haired woman\u2014none of whom looked like the picture he had of Clara Hart, though.Being a white wolf in summer had made it difficult to blend in, so he\u2019d had to keep well out of sight.Candice Mayfair was definitely the author of the books on the website, though she didn\u2019t look like the photo her uncle had of her, if she was Clara Hart. She had the same compelling eyes, different color, but they got his attention, grabbed hold, and wouldn\u2019t let go.He carried her to her couch and set her down, staying close, his hand still on her arm until she seemed to regain her equilibrium.\u201cThe wolf pup was yours,\u201d she accused, jerking her arm away from him.\u201cWolf pup?\u201d\u201cYeah, wolf pup. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know about your own wolf pup.\u201dThen all the pieces began to fall into place. Campers. Campfire. Food. Corey, the wolf pup she had to be referring to, hadn\u2019t just found the food like they\u2019d thought. Candice must not have been a wolf until that night.\u201cYou fed him? Corey? His mom wondered why he smelled of beef jerky that night. We thought he\u2019d found some at the campsite. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026he bit you.",

Not like now.Nikolai removed his fingers, then placed a gentler openmouthed kiss on her sex, licking slowly with the flat of his tongue. Sienna whimpered and scooted up the bed, far too sensitive there now.He gazed up and grinned, licking his bottom lip before he sucked the two fingers he\u2019d had inside of her with a long slide from his mouth. \u201cI could taste you forever.\u201d\u201cMy heart would give out in a day,\u201d she panted, incredulous he would do and say something so naughty. \u201cPerhaps in an hour.\u201dHe chuckled and launched himself up and over her. \u201cI like seeing that flush in your cheeks.\u201d He nipped her lips. \u201cAnd hearing that smile in your voice.\u201dShe wondered how he could see anything, but then again, he was vampire. \u201cWell, I like breathing.\u201d She panted heavily still. \u201cSo give me a moment to catch my breath.\u201dHe settled beside her, pulled the covers over them, and wrapped a strong arm around her waist, pulling her over till her head rested on his chest. \u201cTake all the time you need.\u201dHis voice was light and airy, unlike his usual brooding self.She tilted her head toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cQuite.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced something like that before.\u201dShe had no experience with men, but she thought she knew enough from watching farm animals. Apparently not.\u201cI am certainly glad to hear that,\u201d he said only slightly more serious. \u201cIf another man tried to do that to you, I\u2019d have to rip out his tongue.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very territorial.\u201d\u201cVery. Glad you\u2019ve noted.\u201dStrange how that act of intimacy had washed away the angst and tension from before. Then she realized that was exactly what he was trying to do. He\u2019d wanted her pleasure alone, he\u2019d said. He\u2019d certainly gotten it.\u201cIs it always like that?\u201d she asked, almost too shy, but enjoying the intimacy that had grown between them in the dark.\u201cNo.\u201d He flatted his palm, fingers spread, over her abdomen under the covers. \u201cIt will be better next time.\u201d\u201cBetter?\u201dHe laughed and lowered his head, sweeping his lips across hers. Not a kiss, but a reminder that they\u2019d knocked down a wall between them and there was no rebuilding it.Then he whispered, \u201cWait till you see what it feels like when I\u2019m buried deep inside you.",

One minute, you\u2019re drinking a beer with your friends, talking about the increasingly scary storm outside; the next, you\u2019re flying through the air with your body slamming into the nearest wall when lightning strikes. Or rather, when lightning strikes inside the room and hits you and six of your friends dead center.Eliana Sawyer\u2019s life changed the moment she felt the energy of the gods ricochet through her body. The world as she knew it became grey, and the things that went bump in the night became all too real. The paranormal world wasn\u2019t that of fiction anymore; now, she lived it. The way she saw the world, the way she saw life and fate changed. She couldn\u2019t plan a future the same way she had. She couldn\u2019t fall in love the way she\u2019d thought to in the past.After the lightning strike, six of her friends had found out the hard way what happened when they fell in love with someone paranormal\u2014they became paranormal themselves.Now, years later, here Eliana was\u2014alone, all too human, and on the outside looking in.Of course, she wasn\u2019t that alone anymore. She never would be again. While her friends had fallen for angels, demons, dragons, and wolves, she\u2019d fallen for a mere human. A human that had taken her heart and shattered it into a thousand pieces, all the while leaving her with nothing but an echo of what he had once been, what they had once been together.That wasn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019d left her with.He\u2019d also left the life currently growing in her womb.",

    "quote": "Sitting in a bar for hours on end wouldn\u2019t help matters, but Tristan Archer figured he might as well try it out. It may take him far longer to get drunk than it would if he were human, yet he figured he\u2019d give it a go. After the hellish few months he\u2019d had, he would try anything at this point.He ran a hand through his short, auburn hair that tended to look brown in the bar\u2019s lighting and sighed. He shouldn\u2019t have accepted his friend Levi\u2019s invitation to dinner and drinks at Dante\u2019s Circle in the human realm. He should have rejected the offer and gone back to the thousand other things he had to do within the fae realm and inside the Conclave.Tristan wasn\u2019t just any fae. He was a nine-hundred-year-old fae prince with responsibilities that lay heavily on his shoulders. He was also a Conclave member, where he helped govern every paranormal realm in existence with another fae member and two others from each race. That was how he\u2019d become friends with Levi, a wizard and prince in his own right.So here he was, in Dante\u2019s Circle, a bar owned and named after a royal blue dragon; the meeting place of seven women and their mates with a history he couldn\u2019t immediately comprehend.Of course, it was because one of those women that he\u2019d rather be in the fae realm instead of the dark bar with oak paneling and photos on the walls that spoke of generations of memories and connections. He\u2019d been here a few times in the past, always on the outside of the circle of lightning-struck woman and their mates, but never fully excluded.They\u2019d welcomed Tristan into their fold, even if they didn\u2019t understand why it hurt him so to be that close to what he couldn\u2019t have.Or maybe they understood all too well. After all, one of their own was the reason for his confusion, his torture. The object of his desire.\u201cIf you keep glowering at her over in the corner, you\u2019ll end up scaring her more than she already is,\u201d Seth said from his side.Tristan closed his eyes and took a deep breath, immediately regretting the action as soon as he did. The man next to him smelled of the sea. And hope. His heart ached and his dick filled.Seth Oceanus was a merman, a friend, and his mate.His true half.Or at least one of them.Not that he or Seth could do anything about it when the other part of their triad didn\u2019t feel the same way.",

    "quote": "So what did you and Landon do this afternoon?\u201d Minka asked, her soft voice dragging him back to the present.Angelo looked up to see that Minka had already polished off two fajitas. Damn, the girl could eat. \u201cLandon gave me a tour of the DCO complex. I did some target shooting and blew up a few things. He even let me play with the expensive surveillance toys. I swear, it felt more like a recruiting pitch to get me to work there than anything.\u201dMinka\u2019s eyes flashed green, her full lips curving slightly. Damn, why the hell had he said it like that? Now she probably thought he was going to come work for the DCO. Even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t, not after just reenlisting for another five years. The army wasn\u2019t the kind of job where you could walk into the boss\u2019s office and say, \u201cI quit.\u201dThinking it would be a good idea to steer the conversation back to safer ground, he reached for another fajita and asked Minka a question instead. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll work on next with Ivy and Tanner? You going to practice with the claws for a while or move on to something else?\u201dAngelo felt a little crappy about changing the subject, but if Minka noticed, she didn\u2019t seem to mind. And it wasn\u2019t like he had to fake interest in what she was saying. Anything that involved Minka was important to him. Besides, he didn\u2019t know much about shifters or hybrids, so the whole thing was pretty damn fascinating.\u201cWhat do you visualize when you see the beast in your mind?\u201d he asked.\u201cBefore today, I thought of it as a giant, blurry monster. But after learning that the beast is a cat, that\u2019s how I picture it now.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot a little house cat, of course. They aren\u2019t scary enough. More like a big cat that roams the mountains.\u201d \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said. Minka set the other half of her fourth fajita on her plate and gave him a curious look. \u201cWould you mind if I ask you a personal question?\u201dHis mouth twitched as he prepared another fajita. He wasn\u2019t used to Minka being so reserved. She usually said whatever was on her mind, regardless of whether it was personal or not.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said.\u201cThe first time we met, I had claws, fangs, glowing red eyes, and I tried to kill you. Since then, I\u2019ve spent most of the time telling you about an imaginary creature that lives inside my head and makes me act like a monster. How are you so calm about that? Most people would have run away already.\u201dAngelo chuckled. Not exactly the personal question he\u2019d expected, but then again Minka rarely did the expected.\u201cWell, my mom was full-blooded Cherokee, and I grew up around all kinds of Indian folktales and legends. My dad was in the army, and whenever he was deployed, Mom would take my sisters and me back to the reservation where she grew up in Oklahoma. I\u2019d stay up half the night listening to the old men tell stories about shape-shifters, animal spirits, skin-walkers, and trickster spirits.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I necessarily believed in all that stuff back then, but after meeting Ivy, Tanner, and the other shifters at the DCO, it just didn\u2019t faze me that much.\u201d Minka looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a real American Indian? Like in the movies? With horses and everything?\u201dHe laughed again. The expression of wonder on her face was adorable. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m only half-Indian. My dad is Mexican, so there\u2019s that. And second, Native Americans are almost nothing like you see in the movies. We don\u2019t all live in tepees and ride horses. In fact, I don\u2019t even own a horse.\u201d Minka was a little disappointed about the no-horse thing, but she was fascinated with what it was like growing up on an Indian reservation and being surrounded by all those legends. She immediately asked him to tell her some Indian stories. It had been a long time since he\u2019d thought about them, but to make her happy, he dug through his head and tried to remember every tale he\u2019d heard as a kid.",

Now what? Explain that a friend had given them to her when her last boyfriend and she had parted company? Or just ignore the fact that they were drinking out of those cups while she was having hot cocoa with him and pretend she wasn\u2019t embarrassed to the tip of her toes?He brought the mugs over. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a can of whipped cream in the fridge, if you want some.\u201d\u201cReal cream,\u201d he said, eyeing the can. \u201cLooks good.\u201d He gave it to her, and he lifted the mugs.She shook up the can and pointed it at the right mug, pushed the nozzle, and the cream dripped and fizzled. Not to be thwarted, she shook it again, hoping that it wasn\u2019t defective. And then the whipped cream swirled around with perfect ridges in a twirl on top with a cute little pointy peak. Perfect.Then she turned to the other mug, shook the can again, and pushed the nozzle. It was working great until halfway through her little mountain of whipped cream twirling to perfection, when the nozzle malfunctioned again and spewed whipped cream everywhere.In horror, she stopped what she was doing and stared at the white cream splattered all over Allan\u2019s chest and a few that had dotted his boxer briefs. Her mouth agape, she glanced up at him.His eyes sparkled with mirth and he laughed.\u201cOh, oh, let me get something to wipe it up,\u201d she said, belatedly, and set the can of whipped cream on the counter.She grabbed some paper towels and wetted them, then rushed back to wipe the mess up. He was still holding onto both hot pink mugs of cocoa. She had every intention of taking one of the mugs and letting him clean himself, but he just moved his arms apart as if to say she made the mess, she could wash it up.She thought she was going to die. Yes, he was totally hot. And yes, she\u2019d fantasized about making love to him\u2014since they were both unattached, and she truly liked him.

    "quote": "Mate. He\u2019d told Hayden he would stick to his routine. That meant watching the game at her apartment on Sunday and maintaining their friendship. His logical mind fought against his growing urges. Last night, he couldn\u2019t have a simple conversation without touching her. And she didn\u2019t make things any easier. He could smell the desire pouring out of her. It took every ounce of his self-control to hold himself back. At times, it was painful. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve got the situation under control.\u201d\tCam laughed. \u201cLike you did yesterday? Dude, we both know it\u2019s only going to get worse. You\u2019re like a ticking sex bomb.\u201d\tDeep down, Kaden knew he was right. Annabelle would become an irresistible, unquenchable thirst. Ordinarily, she would feel the same pull, but there was no way to know how a human would react. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a sex bomb.\u201d\tCam spread himself flat across the sofa with his arms crossed behind his head. \u201cYeah, well, there definitely should be.\u201d\t\u201cBe serious.\u201d\tHe sat up. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you, it\u2019s foolish to fight the bond between you. You\u2019d be better off going with it and letting the panties drop where they may.\u201d\tAnd what would happen if he did bond with her? There was no chance it would ever work out between them. He had to hide who he was from the world. A life with him meant Annabelle would have to lie to her friends and family about their relationship. He would never be able to marry her or give her the children she wanted. They\u2019d talked about her dreams for a white picket fence and a family. Even if she were willing to give up those things, wouldn\u2019t he be putting her life in danger? A dull ache formed in the pit of his chest. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\tIf he could somehow push away these human emotions of his, maybe he stood a chance of keeping her in his life. Maybe someday he could actually be happy for her if she found a suitable mate. He dug his fingernails into the palms of his hands at the thought of her with a human. \u201cI have to go. She\u2019s waiting for me.\u201d\t\u201cDon\u2019t forget the condoms,\u201d Cam shouted out. \u201cMatter of fact, you might want to double up. With all your pent-up frustration, there\u2019s bound to be an explosion.\u201d\t\u201cHilarious,\u201d he replied, shutting the door behind him as he made his way toward his truck. Once inside, he slid his seat belt on and leaned back against the head cushion with his eyes closed. Filled with self-doubt, he worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. But he had to.\tFor the sake of everyone he loved, he had to find a way.",

The banished and disgraced Dragon King hadn\u2019t just made a nuisance of himself, but he somehow managed to get his magic returned.Which meant the Kings needed to put extra magic into keeping the four silver dragons sleeping undisturbed deep within the mountain. They were Ulrik\u2019s dragons, and he would want to wake them soon.But it wasn\u2019t just Ulrik that was causing mischief. The Dark Fae were as well. It infuriated Arian that they were once more fighting the Dark. Hadn\u2019t the Fae Wars killed enough Fae and dragons?Then again, as a Dragon King as old as time itself, they were targets for others who wanted to defeat them.For Ulrik, he just wanted revenge. Arian hated him for it, but he could understand. Mostly because Arian had briefly joined Ulrik in his quest to rid the realm of humans.Thoughts of Ulrik were pushed aside as Arian found himself thinking about why he had taken to his mountain. When he came here six hundred years earlier, it was to remain there for many thousands of years.The Dragon Kings sought their mountains for many reasons. Some were just tired of dealing with mortals, but others had something they wished to forget for a while. Arian was one of the latter.There were many things he did in his past when the King of Kings, Constantine, asked. Not all of them Arian was proud of. The one that sent him to his mountain still preyed upon him.He didn\u2019t remember her name, but he remembered her tears. Because of the spell to prevent any of the Dragon Kings from falling in love with mortals, Arian had easily walked away from the female.Six centuries later, he could still hear her begging him to stay with her, still see the tears coursing down her face. Though he hadn\u2019t felt anything, it bothered him that he had so easily walked away. Because Con had demanded it.Loyalty\u2014above all else.The Dragon Kings were his family, and Dreagan his home. There was never any question if he were needed that Arian would do whatever it took to help his brethren in any capacity asked of him.",

He needed to get her,and her car, far from this place so neither he nor Kate would beimplicated in any way with the gruesome murder site.It also meant he would have to drive.In all his years, he had never driven an automobile. The closest hehad come was watching various assistants through the years as theychauffeured him. He wasn\u2019t sure he could even remember how tostart the car, but right now he had no choice.Grudgingly, he got into the driver\u2019s seat, and finding the leverunderneath, he pushed it back so he sat comfortably behind thewheel. After trying three different keys, he found one that slipped intothe ignition.From what he had seen over the past hundred years, driving wasnot a complex operation, and he was an immortal with reflexes farmore keen than a human man.How difficult could it be?He turned the key and nearly jerked the wheel off the steeringcolumn when the car surprised him by lurching forward. The car wentsilent. The engine wasn\u2019t running. What was he doing wrong?He stared at the gearshift, wondering if he should move it. Hisfrustration reared up, but his agitation would not make the car driveitself. He had to keep a cool head.Not knowing what else to try, he pushed one of the pedals at hisfeet to the floor and turned the key again. This time the car didn\u2019tmove, and it roared to life. Grasping the gearshift, he jammed it intothe first position and glanced over at Kate.Why couldn\u2019t she have owned a car with an automatictransmission?Shaking his head, he put some pressure on the gas pedal andslowly released the clutch. Thankfully the car rolled a few feet, butwithout warning it jumped forward. He pressed the clutch back to thefloor before the engine lost power again.Calisto slammed his hand against the wheel, muttering under hisbreath in Spanish. At this rate it would take him all night to drive herhome.The faded yellow convertible pitched forward again, threateningto stall as he continued out of the parking lot, thankful it was late. Thestreets were fairly empty. At least he wouldn\u2019t get into an accidentwith another car. Her car staggered ahead, lurching each time hetried to release the clutch, bouncing and jostling them both until Katefinally stirred and woke up.\u00a7\u201cAre we out of gas or something?\u201dCalisto watched her with a tight smile. \u201cNot exactly.\u201dKate winced in pain when she laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive a stickshift,can you?\u201d\u201cDoes it show?\u201d Calisto pulled over, finally allowing the engine tostall.She nodded her head slowly to avoid more pain. \u201cJust a little.What happened?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d\u201cI remember being mugged. And I remember seeing you, buteverything after that is blank.\u201d She watched his eyes as Calistoreached over to brush her hair back from her face, and his touch sentshivers through her body. This wasn\u2019t how she had hoped she wouldrun into him, but she learned a long time ago fate didn\u2019t always workout the way you expected.",

When he straightened up, she realized he\u2019d been talking, but she didn\u2019t have a clue what he had said. Instead, all her attention was focused on a fine trail of dark hair leading from just below his navel and disappearing under the low-slung elastic band of his boxer briefs.\u201cMuriah?\u201dHer gaze snapped up to meet his. Thank the universe he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. \u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cDid you hear my question?\u201dHe stood two feet from her in only his underwear, and he thought she was listening? He was either completely unaware of his sex appeal, or he was way too accustomed to being obeyed.Probably both.She cleared her throat. \u201cI must\u2019ve missed it.\u201dA spark lit his eyes that told her he might have more than a clue to his sex appeal.He picked up the T-shirt and pulled it on. \u201cI asked if you knew of another hotel closer to the airport so we can get out of New York as soon as the sun sets tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I can find one.\u201d She pulled out her phone, grateful to have something to pretend to focus on besides him tucking his package into the new khakis she pulled off the rack for him.\u201cI probably should\u2019ve grabbed some dry underwear, too.\u201d\u201cThey are nearly dry now. I will be fine.\u201d He popped the tags off, and she glanced up from her hotel search. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to like you taking the tags off before you pay.\u201dThe corner of his mouth curved up. \u201cThey will be honored to take my money.\u201dShe groaned and rolled her eyes. \u201cDo you ever not get your way?\u201dHe stepped closer to her, his chest an inch from hers until her back pressed against the modular wall of the fitting room. \u201cRarely.\u201d His dark gaze held hers, and the deep rumble of his voice sent heat through her body. \u201cBut some things are worth the extra effort.",

The disappearance of her baby sister and sudden departure from her home had taught the ten-year-old that life was filled with uncertainties. But she was willing to forget that for a little while.She jumped down from the barrel and headed toward Liam, Felix, and the other shipmates. They would sing shanties and talk of the constellations, the sea, its creatures, and the legends. It would get her through another night.La Suerte was the only stability for her passengers with the infinite unknown all around them. The waters of the sea, the world below the surface, and the sky that stretched beyond the horizon was a representation of the limitless possibilities and dangers awaiting those aboard.",

I lifted her off of it with great care, unsure if she had the strength to stand. As soon as her arms were free, she looped them around my shoulders and pressed her face against my neck. She was trembling, but not crying. I sank to the floor and cradled her in my lap, breathing out the last of my anger now that she was safe. \u201c\u2018M sorry,\u201d she mumbled in a small voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Michael.\u201dI snorted. \u201cWhat the hell do you have to apologize for?
