    "quote": "Friendship is a serious affection  the most sublime of all affections  because it is founded on principle  and cemented by time. The very reverse may be said of love. In a great degree  love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom  even when inspired by different objects they weaken or destroy each other  and for the same object can only be felt in succession. The vain fears and fond jealousies  the winds which fan the flame of love  when judiciously or artfully tempered  are both incompatible with the tender confidence and sincere respect of friendship.",

Neither be cynical about love  for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years  gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline  be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars  you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God  whatever you conceive Him to be  and whatever your labours and aspirations  in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham  drudgery and broken dreams  it is still a beautiful world.",
