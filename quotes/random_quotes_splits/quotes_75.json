Speak your truth quietly and clearly  and listen to others  even the dull and ignorant  they too have their story. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love - for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years  gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline  be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars  you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God  whatever you conceive Him to be  and whatever your labours and aspirations  in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham  drudgery and broken dreams  it is still a beautiful world.",
